working with Kong and Insomnia

Been doing training for Kong Gateway and Kong Service Mesh and one of the modules includes API documenting, which is done via OpenAPI (formerly Swagger).  I've used the Insomnia tool before, but not for awhile, so this has been a good refresher and I learned a few things about how it should be applied.
